      <h1>Analysing and modelling epidemic data Lusaka workshop 2022</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to the Imperial College London / Zambart workshop
        "Analysing and modelling epidemic data"
        (<a href="http://www.infectiousdiseasemodels.org/">infectiousdiseasemodels.org</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        This course will be taught using an interface built using an R
        package called
        <code>shiny</code> using
        the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming
          language</a>. Over the 10 day programme you will be using
        this interface to explore and understand the basics of
        analysing epidemic data and dynamic transmission modelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The links below will take you to the practical and project
        materials and interface you will use over the next two weeks. Links to course materials and solutions will become active as the course
        progresses so be sure to check back regularly.
      </p>

        <li><a href="week2.html">Projects (Week 2 Monday - Wednesday)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Help</h2>

      <p>
        A general help file for writing model (<code>odin</code>) code
        and navigating the interface can be
        found <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/infectiousdiseasemodels-2022/guide/">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For help transitioning from using the shiny interface into writing models directly in R and Rstudio after the course, we
        have <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/infectiousdiseasemodels-2022/transition/">compiled a list of useful resources and a
        simple examples</a>.
